# Tribute Page Project (Responsive Web)

This is the first responsive web project that I built using plain HTML and CSS! 

The “Tribute Page” is the first of the five final projects that the FreeCodeCamp course “Responsive Web Design” requires to gain the certification (course: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/ ).

To pass the FreeCodeCamp test for this project we have to fulfill this user stories: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page 

On top of the course requirements, I wanted to add a Parallax Scrolling, more images and gifs, a timeline section and a grid of flipping cards with embed links to Spotify. 

I had so much fun building this project. Hope you enjoy it too!

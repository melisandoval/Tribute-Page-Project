# Tribute Page Project (Responsive Web)

This is the first responsive web project that I built using plain HTML and CSS! 

The “Tribute Page” is the first of the five final projects that the [FreeCodeCamp course “Responsive Web Design”](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/) requires to gain the certification.

On top of the [course requirements](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page), I wanted to add a Parallax Scrolling, more images and gifs, a timeline section and a grid of flipping cards with embed links to Spotify. 

I had so much fun building this project. Hope you enjoy it too! [Here you can see it online](https://melisandoval.github.io/Tribute-Page-Project/).
